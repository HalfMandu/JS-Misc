	Arr[0] Returns the root node.

	Get max or min element - O(1)
		
	Remove max or min element  - O(Log n) 
		need to maintain the max/mix at root node...Log n operations
	
	Insert element - O(Log n) 
		insert the value at the end of the tree and bubble up to restore heap property
	
	1) Shape Property: A binary heap is a complete binary tree, this means all of the levels of the tree are completely filled except possibly the last level. The nodes are filled from left to right.
	2) Heap Property: The value stored in each node is either (greater than or equal to) OR (less than or equal to ) itâ€™s children depending if it is a max heap or a min heap.

	Building a heap from an array of n input elements can be done by starting with an empty heap, then successively inserting each element. 
		This algorithm runs O( n log n) time. 
	However this method is suboptimal and a faster algorithm was created by Floyd, which starts by putting the elements on a binary tree, respecting the shape property, 
	then starting from the lowest level and moving upwards
